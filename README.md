# ci40gpio

An Python3 example showing an LED flashing on a breadboard using the Raspberry Pi connector GPIO. This makes use of pyletmecreate (https://github.com/francois-berder/PyLetMeCreate).

By default is uses MFIO_83 (PIN 37 - See linked pinmap below), but can be configured by changing the GPIO_NUM variable.
